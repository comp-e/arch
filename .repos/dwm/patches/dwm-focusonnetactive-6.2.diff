Subject: [PATCH] Activate a window in response to _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW

By default, dwm response to client requests to _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client
messages by setting the urgency bit on the named window.

This patch activates the window instead.

Both behaviours are legitimate according to
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html#idm140200472702304

One should decide which of these one should perform based on the message
senders' untestable claims that it represents the end-user. Setting the
urgency bit is the conservative decision. This patch implements the more
trusting alternative.

It also allows dwm to work with `wmctrl -a` and other external window
management utilities
