Subject: [PATCH] Zero depth safeguard for dwm

The colour depth attribute of an X window represents the number of bits
that are used to represent the colour.

A window that has a depth of 0 suggests that it does not support colours
and is therefore not intended to be displayed.

Mapping a window that has a depth of 0 will result in dwm crashing and
this safeguard will avoid that.

An example of this would be one of the hidden windows that the firefox
browser manages.

$ xdotool search firefox
Defaulting to search window name, class, classname, and role
77594627
77594625
77594681
77594684

Two of the windows listed above should have a depth of 0, this can be
checked using xwininfo like this:

$ xwininfo -id 77594625

xwininfo: Window id: 0x4a00001 "Firefox"

  Absolute upper-left X:  10
  Absolute upper-left Y:  10
  Relative upper-left X:  10
  Relative upper-left Y:  10
  Width: 10
  Height: 10
  Depth: 0
  Visual: 0x506
  Visual Class: TrueColor
  Border width: 0
  Class: InputOnly
  Colormap: 0x0 (not installed)
  Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
  Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
  Backing Store State: NotUseful
  Save Under State: no
  Map State: IsUnMapped
  Override Redirect State: no
  Corners:  +10+10  -6180+10  -6180-1900  +10-1900
  -geometry 10x10+10+10

The window can then be explicitly mapped using xdotool.

$ xdotool windowmap 77594625

Without the safeguard dwm should crash following the above command.

It should be noted that these kind of windows are not intended to
be explicitly mapped like this and they won't be under normal
circumstances.

If you are trying to write a script that uses tools like mapw or
xdotool to map and unmap windows then you may want to add some
checks to avoid that you don't include windows that have a depth
of 0.
